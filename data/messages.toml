syntaxhelp = '''
The 2.5 Mega Refactoring™ includes a new command parser, rewritten from the ground up to make command syntax more homogeneous and provide more verbose error messages.
New commands can have arguments of 3 datatypes: strings, numbers, and lists of strings. The syntax for these types is as follows:
Strings: "content"
Numbers: <normal numbers, nothing's changed here>
Strarrays: [item,item,item]
The help for commands is now automatically generated, and comes with annotations so you can easily figure out what type an argument has.
